## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}



```


```{r}
test <- "hello"

inital_pubchem_data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\jonat_od7omk3\\Desktop\\CSCI_5622\\project\\pub_chem_1000_compounds.csv")


#get only the columns with number of carbons, hydrogens, oxygens and nitrogens
num_common_el <- inital_pubchem_data[7:10]

head(num_common_el)

```
```{r}

num_common_el_data_std <- scale(num_common_el) #if you don't do the previous two steps before using hclust, the data isn't the correct data type (it needs to be a "dissimilarity matrix")
num_common_el_data.dist <- dist(num_common_el_data_std)
hc.out_num_common_el_data <- hclust(num_common_el_data.dist, method = "complete")

hc.out_num_common_el_data
```


```{r}
plot(hc.out_num_common_el_data)
rect.hclust(hc.out_num_common_el_data, k=3, border = 2:5)
```

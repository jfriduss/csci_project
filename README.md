I am terrible at using github at the moment, but I FYI I forgot to give credit to scikit-learn's silhouette tutorial, in the k means section (I have updated the jupyter notebook on my computer, but haven't pushed the update here yet, beccause I am not good enough at git yet, and so I want to push it once I have done more than just this).
